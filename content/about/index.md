Hi, I'm Amanda. I've worn a lot of hats working with data in geophysics, finance, civic tech, social good projects, business analytics, and numerous hobbies for _a long time_. I love puzzles and problem solving.

Outside of my data work, I enjoy beekeeping, various fiber arts, rock climbing, exploring the mountains, baking, tacos, and helping my kids explore new hobbies/passions of their own.
