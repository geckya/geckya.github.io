[NormConf](https://normconf.com/), the coolest conference to ever be [tweeted into existence](https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1552066833582276610), is coming! The main event, with live talks, happens across 15+ glorious hours on 2022-12-15, but the [Lightning Talks](https://normconf.com/#lightning-talks) (prerecorded 5 minute presentations) will be released ten days earlier - (that's the day after tomorrow).

I'm giving a meme-loaded Lightning Talk titled **Minimizing the Cost Function in Data Projects
_(or, Keep it Simple, Stupid)_**. Five minutes isn't much time, and I've definitely got more thoughts, so I'm looking forward to continuing the discussion afterward - here, on the NormConf Slack, and anywhere else I find someone willing to listen to me rant about data product design and maintenance.
