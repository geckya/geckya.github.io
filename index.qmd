Hi, I’m Amanda. I’m a data and computational scientist who's worn a lot of hats doing full-stack data work and technical advocacy in geophysics, finance, civic tech, social good projects, business analytics, and numerous hobbies. I love puzzles and problem solving.

Outside of my data work, I enjoy beekeeping, various fiber arts, rock climbing, exploring the mountains, baking, tacos, and helping my kids explore new hobbies/passions of their own.
