    "text": "In 2022, I gave a NormConf Lightning Talk called Minimizing the Cost Function in Data Projects (or, Keep it Simple, Stupid).\nIn the early days of Dockless Bikeshare in Washington, DC, I did work that helped inform the decision making process for whether to continue the pilot, starting from some high-level policy questions and some data that no one had ever really worked with before.\nPartnering with an immigration law non-profit, I’ve done a few projects in support of their work (both for public consumption and for use in their legal work), including:\n\nScraping and visualizing USCIS data on DACA recipients\nBuilding and analyzing datasets to obtain a deeper understanding of the demographics of the refugees from countries affected by various shifting immigration policies.\n\nDuring my time working in computational geophysics, I had the opportunity to author/coauthor a number of scientific publications. One particularly nice example of cutting-edge work my colleagues and I did on reservoir saturation prediction was this Barents Sea Case Study. Check out Google Scholar for a full bibliography.\nData invades my hobbies, too. With a friend, I created Wearing Wiki, a reference site for babywearing techniques using woven wraps. The Wearing Wiki improved the accessibility of this instructional information for caregivers of all body types and abilities."

I’m a data and computational scientist who’s worn a lot of hats doing full-stack data work and technical advocacy in geophysics, finance, civic tech, social good projects, business analytics, and numerous hobbies. I love puzzles and problem solving.\nOutside of my data work, I enjoy beekeeping, various fiber arts, rock climbing, exploring the mountains, baking, tacos, and helping my kids explore new hobbies/passions of their own."
