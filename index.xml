The main event, with live talks, happens across 15+ glorious hours on 2022-12-15, but the Lightning Talks (prerecorded 5 minute presentations) will be released ten days earlier - (that&amp;rsquo;s the day after tomorrow).
I&amp;rsquo;m giving a meme-loaded Lightning Talk titled Minimizing the Cost Function in Data Projects (or, Keep it Simple, Stupid). Five minutes isn&amp;rsquo;t much time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely got more thoughts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to continuing the discussion afterward - here, on the NormConf Slack, and anywhere else I find someone willing to listen to me rant about data product design and maintenance.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://gecky.me/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://gecky.me/about/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Amanda. I&amp;rsquo;ve worn a lot of hats working with data in geophysics, finance, civic tech, social good projects, business analytics, and numerous hobbies for a long time. I have strong feelings about the design and management of data products.
Outside my data work, I enjoy various fiber arts, rock climbing, baking, tacos, and helping my kids explore new hobbies/passions of their own.</description></item></channel></rss>
